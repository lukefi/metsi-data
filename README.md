# MENU forest data model

This project is a collection of Python classes usable describing a structured object model of forest stands with contained tree stratum and reference tree.
The classes were originally created from the RSD data format specification of the MELA forest calculation utility.
Going forward they will serve as an unified model for Finnish national forest survey (VMI) and Finnish forestry centre (SMK) data sources.
Utilities for conversion of the data for known application targets are provided, namely the Motti growth models and Mela 2.0 growth and forest management operation models.

Backwards compatibility with semantic versioning is guaranteed for users of this library.
